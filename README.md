# Software Developer Exercise: Menu management

A small restaurant wants a web application to manage their menus. They have no preferred framework or tools, no preference on server-side or client-side. The focus is not on CSS, so we strongly recommend using a framework such as Bootstrap so you can focus on back-end code instead of styles.

Several stories have been identified as required, and some are optional (pick two).

## Required Stories (Complete all 3)

 - [ ] A user should be able to enter, edit, and remove menu items. The menu items have a name, a description, a category (such as appetizer, main course, side, dessert), and a price. (Unless you do the optional story, we’re not concerned with user logins or security)
 - [ ] A user should be able to view the menu, with items grouped by category, and see the names, descriptions, and prices.
 - [ ] The menu view should allow users to select items off the menu. On submitting the form, they should be able to see the total price of their potential order. A user should be able to adjust the quantity of items in their order.

## Optional Stories (Complete exactly 2)

 - [ ] Restrict the ability to enter, edit, and remove menu items to a logged-in administrator.
 - [ ] When the user sees their total order, they can add an optional tip of 10%, 15%, or 20%, and resubmit the order to see the total with tip.
 - [ ] The administrator can identify an item as being a “daily special”, only available on a given day of the week. Daily specials are all displayed on the user menu, but only the specials for the current day can be ordered by the user.
 - [ ] The administrator can optionally upload an image to go along with an item, if so, the image is displayed in the menu
 - [ ] The user can enter a minimum and maximum amount of money, click “I feel lucky” and get a random order between the minimum and maximum amounts.
 - [ ] he administrator can create different menus for lunch and dinner that have different, but potentially overlapping, sets of items. The user can select which menu to view.
